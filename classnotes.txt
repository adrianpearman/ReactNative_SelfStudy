create-react-native init #projectname

to launch the simulator, run the command
For iOs: react-native run-ios
For Android: react-native run-android

first two modules for ios and android are very rarely changed (only on rare circumstances that these files will be changed by us)

React - knows how a component should behave
knows how to take a bunch of components and make them work together

React Native - knows how to take the output from a component and make it display on a mobile device
provides default core components (image, text)

Components take in developer code and convert it to JSX

One of the main differences between React and React Native is that to add styling to a component, the rules must be added directly as opposed to a seperate css file like web applications.

<Text> = displays text
<View> = displays how it is positioned
